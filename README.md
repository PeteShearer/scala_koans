## Learn Scala with Scala Koans
###This repo is a port from [the Mercurial version](https://bitbucket.org/dmarsh/scalakoansexercises/) onto Git.

###To Get Started
[Get SBT](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup) 

While in the scala_koans project directory that you downloaded from this project:
Run the command *sbt* to put yourself in the interactive sbt console.
Run the command *run* from sbt to execute the sample Hello, World! app. This will verify that your project should be ready.

Finally,
Run the command *test-quick org.functionalkoans.forscala.AboutAsserts* from sbt to run the first Scala Koan.
Run the command *update* from sbt to download the necessary dependencies if you need to.

Open the org/functionalkoans/forscala/PathToEnlightenment.scala file in an editor to see the proper order for running the Koans.

Go at your own pace.
